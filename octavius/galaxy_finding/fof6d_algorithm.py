"""

Octavius 6D friends-of-friends galaxy-finding algorithm which utilises cell linked-lists,
an algorithm originally used in molecular dynamics simulation codes to avoid naïve O(N^2)
checks in groups by partitioning the data into cells with a cutoff radius beyond which particles
are not checked. This is conceptually similar to a k-d tree, however, the difference comes down
to how data is partitioned. k-d trees partition space by data density, which means they are optimal
for adaptive queries. For example, consider wanting to find galaxy local number densities. If this
galaxy is in a cosmic void, its neighbours might be megaparsecs away, whereas in a node it could
be kiloparsecs. The k-d tree adapts to either case as its density-based leaf structure allows
it to traverse voids or zoom in on nodes.

Friends-of-friends is (in our case) based on a fixed linking length. Cell linked-lists are
based on fixed cell sizes; meaning partitioning is spatially-based rather than density-based,
which is therefore more suited to fixed distance queries. We specifically store the linked
list in CSR format.

The previous Octavius FOF6D framework used the scipy.spatial and scipy.sparse framework,
vectorising the galaxy-finding approach with k-d tree -> sparse distance matrix -> sparse adjacency matrix
-> connected components. However, this approach involves O(E) scaling where E is Nk and k
is the average number of nearest neighbours. Therefore, in highly dense regions where k tends
to N, the resulting O(N^2) scaling became untenable in memory. This could also occur for
moderately-dense haloes with enormous number counts. By writing this new algorithm in numba
we use a union find to construct the connected components, thereby avoiding holding all edges
in memory simultaneously.
