# Format-Specific Information

The internals of the pipeline are agnostic to the simulation (and halo catalogue) type which it receives: snapshot and membership data are parsed into internal data structures which follow defined conventions.

## Halo Catalogues

(subhalo-info)=
### General

- The original finder IDs of haloes entering the pipeline are stored under `original_ids` in the catalogue `halo_data`.

When run on a halo catalogue which includes subhaloes, Octavius will map out the hierarchical substructure according to the following prescription:

- Field haloes are identified as haloes with no immediate parent.

- Subhaloes are identified as haloes with an immediate parent.

- For inclusive properties, the particles of subhaloes will be propagated into the membership arrays of their parents.

- Galaxy finding operates at the field halo level: in practice this aligns with the results of the subhalo assignments, but the config flag `subhalo_override` can be enabled to strictly respect the subhalo boundaries as laid out by the finder.

Subhaloes can be identified with the `depth` column in `halo_data`: the column is stored ascending, where depth 0 indicates a field halo.

### AHF

- When specifying the halo catalogue path, you should specify the stem of the catalogue (everything before .AHF_halos), e.g. `AHF_C200_m12.5n128.0000.z3.003.`

- Field halo assignments of particles are made according to the parent field halo of the deepest subhalo to which they belong.

### HBT-HERONS

- The pipeline has currently only been tested on SWIFT-KIARA snapshots with associated HBT-HERONS catalogues.

### FOF

- Halo finding runs on rank 0 before particles are distributed, so rank 0 must be able to hold every particle's position (plus roughly 65 bytes per DM particle of working memory). It uses `cores_per_rank` threads.

- HaloIDs are ordered by descending DM membership, so halo 0 is the largest.

### SUBFIND

- The pipeline will assume the particles in the original snapshot have been re-ordered according to the SUBFIND catalogue assignments.

## Simulation-Specific

### SWIFT

- When running on multi-file SWIFT snapshots, you should specify the virtual dataset HDF5 file as the snapshot path.

- Support for COLIBRE and EAGLE simulations is still nascent.

### TNG

- Hydrogen gas fractions for TNG snapshots are computed according to the derivation laid out in [Stevens et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty3451) (Appendix A1).

- Default GADGET units are assumed.

- Multi-file snapshots are not currently supported.

### SIMBA

- Default GADGET units are assumed.
